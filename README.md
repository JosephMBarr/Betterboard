# Betterboard
Betterboard is an unofficial Chrome Extension that helps improve the aesthetic appeal and usability of Blackboard. Features include:

-graphical improvements, namely movement toward material design

-Roboto font

-removal of extraneous elements from homepage

-collapsed course content and made expandable (increasing readability and ease of navigation)

-announcements are shown as red "!" instead of adding to length of course list

-customizable course names

-hidable courses

-heat-map style grade change notifiers

While it is fully usable, this project is still under active development. If you have suggestions, feel free to contact me. You can install the extension [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/betterboard/lcbgohcpebiaemadmcmkomcckookpjbm).
